# WiFiProfileManagement
Module used for management of wireless profiles.

This module leverages the native WiFi functions.  I wanted to learn more about interoperability and have a PowerShell way to view passwords of WiFi profiles so I decided to work
on this in my free time.  Any feedback on how this module can be improved is welcome.
